# 🦷 Dental Treatment Planning System  

A multi-language (English, Persian, German) web application for dental treatment planning, pricing, and payment.  
This system allows dentists to create complete treatment cases for their patients with an interactive tooth chart and highly dynamic forms.  

## ✨ Key Features
- Patient & Doctor Workflow: Dentists register patients, start treatment cases, and manage all operations.  
- Interactive Tooth Chart: Select teeth, apply services, mirror operations to adjacent/antagonist teeth, and track status visually.  
- Multi-layer Forms: Complex service forms with materials, shapes, dependencies, and nested options (covering up to 5 layers).  
- File Attachments: Upload scans, x-rays, and lab files directly linked to cases or teeth.  
- Pricing & Quotes:  
  - Fixed prices from a service price list.  
  - Custom requests handled by admin approval.  
  - Extra surcharges (urgency, complexity, color).  
- Orders & Payment:  
  - Shopping cart and order system.  
  - Online payment integration (PayPal).  

## 🚀 Why It’s Complex
Unlike a standard booking or CRM system, this project models real-world dental workflows:  
- Treatment cases span multiple teeth and services.  
- Options and materials dynamically change based on dentist choices.  
- Dependencies between services and nested option trees.  
- Support for admin-driven custom pricing before payment.  

This complexity makes it closer to a specialized dental CAD/CAM system than a typical medical app.
